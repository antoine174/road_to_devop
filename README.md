# road_to_devop
road to Devops considering the university materials

hey guys this is Antoine Sobhy CSED 2028 student and this is the road map i shall follow to get in the Devops field

 this road map starts just after the third term  good luck  <3
first of all you dont know what a serveer is or what is deploying (me neither :)  ) but we want to get in the Devops field
so  we will learn step by step 
devops is about deploying a server on a cloud ;  

despite what server or "deploy" is,  we need to make the "server" before we deploy it or use it in anything in genral 

there is alot of frameworks and programming languges to do a server but we chose java.     why ?
1st we are going to study java in the 4th term and it will be really hard so it is better to study it now
2nd since we already know C and C++ learning java would be easy
then we learn spring (framework) and this is because we are going to use in the 5th term and it is relly hard so if we start from now things will get easier


so the road map is

1-learning java and oop

and library managmennt system project using oop

2-learn datastructres
